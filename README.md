The video gives simple yet vivid insight into Git and Github.
Git been a decentralized/distributed version control system (VCS), keeps track of your code history, where you can push (make public/publish) your code from local to remote repositories e.g GitHub, Bitbucket (other developers can have access) or pull (get/download) or clone (copy) codes from other developers.
It also has basic and simple commands and flags very easy installation.
